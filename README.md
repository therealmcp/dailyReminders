# Daily Reminders 

# Overview

It's easy to get so caught up in our day to day responsibilities we forget to take time out for ourselves. Daily reminders is essentially a series of timers the user can set to remind them of tasks that can help create positive habits. Drinking enough water throughtout the day, standing up and walking around, stretching, etc.
